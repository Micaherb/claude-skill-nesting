# Implementation Plan

Implement new code and tests while maintaining good development practices.

---

## Key Steps

1. Write down Plan steps at the top of your todo list.
2. Make commits (using the `commit` skill) whenever a section of code has been completed
    - For shorter plans, this may typically involve one commit for code, another commit for tests
3. Tests should cover new branches in logic. If tests already cover all logic barnches, no code needs to be added
4. Tests should be checked for passign status after being added
