# Documentation Guidelines

When documenting learnings:

## Where

- Write docs as `.md` files in the `/docs` directory
- Use descriptive filenames (e.g., `email-service-integration.md`, `tenant-isolation-patterns.md`)

## When to Document

Only write docs when the learning is:

- **Helpful** - Will genuinely help future coding sessions
- **Concrete** - Specific, actionable information
- **Stable** - Not likely to change soon

## When NOT to Document

Skip documentation for learnings that are:

- **Transient** - Only relevant to this specific task
- **Overly-specific** - Won't apply to future work
- **Subject to change** - Likely to be outdated soon
- **Already documented** - Covered in existing docs or code comments

## Important

Not every task, branch, PR, or ticket requires new docs. Only document when it will genuinely help future work. When in doubt, don't create a new doc file.

## Format

Keep docs concise and scannable:

- Clear title
- Brief context (1-2 sentences)
- The actual learning/information
- Code examples if helpful

## Corrective Documentation

When documenting, also scan `/docs` for files with relevant titles. If existing docs are outdated or incorrect based on your current knowledge, update or correct them. Documentation maintenance is part of documentation.
